# Language Exchange NFT Platform

## Overview

The Language Exchange NFT Platform is a decentralized application built on the Stacks blockchain that facilitates language learning through non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and structured exchange sessions.

## Features

### Language NFT Contract
- Mint unique NFTs representing language contributions
- Store metadata about language contributions
- Transfer NFT ownership
- Retrieve token metadata and ownership information

### Language Exchange Contract
- Register user language preferences
- Create language exchange sessions
- Join existing exchange sessions
- Complete language exchange interactions

## Smart Contracts

### Language NFT Contract

#### Key Functions
- `mint`: Create a new language contribution NFT
- `transfer`: Transfer NFT ownership
- `get-token-metadata`: Retrieve metadata for a specific token
- `get-owner`: Check the owner of a specific token

#### Data Structures
- `token-metadata`: Stores information about each language NFT
    - Token ID
    - Language
    - Contribution Type
    - Contributor

### Language Exchange Contract

#### Key Functions
- `register-languages`: Add languages a user wants to learn/teach
- `create-session`: Initiate a new language exchange session
- `join-session`: Join an existing open session
- `complete-session`: Mark a session as completed
- `get-session`: Retrieve session details
- `get-user-languages`: Fetch a user's registered languages

#### Data Structures
- `exchange-sessions`: Tracks language exchange sessions
    - Session ID
    - Languages involved
    - Participants
    - Session status
- `user-languages`: Stores languages for each user

## Error Handling

The contracts include custom error codes for:
- Owner-only actions
- Invalid token ownership
- Invalid session status
- Non-participant actions

## Use Cases

1. Language Learners can:
    - Mint NFTs for their language learning contributions
    - Register languages they want to learn
    - Create or join language exchange sessions
    - Track their language learning journey through NFTs

2. Language Contributors can:
    - Document and tokenize their language learning experiences
    - Connect with language exchange partners
    - Verify and showcase their linguistic skills

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Stacks wallet
- Basic understanding of language exchange principles
- Familiarity with Stacks blockchain

### Deployment
1. Deploy the Language NFT Contract
2. Deploy the Language Exchange Contract
3. Connect your Stacks wallet

### Example Workflow
1. Mint a Language NFT
2. Register your known and desired languages
3. Create a language exchange session
4. Join a session with a compatible language partner
5. Complete the exchange and earn your NFT

## Security Considerations
- Sessions can only be modified by participants
- Strict status management prevents unauthorized changes
- Owner-only functions protect contract integrity

## Future Improvements
- Add reputation scoring
- Implement more detailed session metadata
- Create a frontend interface
- Integrate with language learning platforms
